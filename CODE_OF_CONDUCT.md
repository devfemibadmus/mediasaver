As a contributor, you can help me keep the WhatsApp Media Saver community open and inclusive. Please read and follow this code of conduct:

## My Pledge

I am committed to creating and maintaining a respectful and inclusive community. Everyone is welcome to participate, regardless of age, background, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## My Standards

Examples of behavior that contribute to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language.
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.
- Focusing on what is best for the community.
- Showing empathy towards other community members.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others' private information, such as physical or electronic addresses, without explicit permission.
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## My Responsibilities

As the project maintainer, I am responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and am expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

I have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that I deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting me at [devfemibadmus@gmail.com](mailto:devfemibadmus@gmail.com). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. I am obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by me, the project's sole maintainer.
